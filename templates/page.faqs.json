Ideally volleyballs and equipment should be stored in a clean, dry location at room temperature. Additionally, volleyballs should be inflated to the recommended pressure. Each ball has a recommended weight printed directly on the ball. Generally balls are recommended to be inflated between 4-6 pounds of pressure. Over-inflating your volleyballs may lead to split seams and shorter life span.<\/p>"}},"4dfef8cc-3df0-47f4-a64c-0a87984c6b67":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"My volleyball isn't holding air.

This allows both teams to have an additional break during the match and is a good indicator of how strenuous beach volleyball can be.<\/p><p>A ball cannot be taken with open hands (set) unless it is hard driven and downward, so sand players often practice multiple ways to take a ball overhead without setting with their fingertips.<\/p><p>Open hand tips are not allowed, usually tip with the knuckles (a \"dink\").<\/p><p>Many sand players choose to bump-set (forearm passing) and not use their hands. Officials are very strict about setting forms, plus, if a player using his or her hands to set the ball and the wind takes it over the net, it will result in a point for the opponents. Even if it is unintentional, it still counts as an open hand tip.<\/p><p>The block counts as one of the three hits, but the blocker can contact the ball a second consecutive time after the block, giving the other player just one hit to play the ball over the net.<\/p><p>Any contact with any part of the net is a violation.<\/p><p>Active coaching is limited to timeouts and in between sets.<\/p><p>Size of entire beach volleyball court (both sides combined) is 52 feet 6 inches x 26 feet 3 inches.<\/p>"}},"256d7291-76a2-4498-98fa-65422f3ad772":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"Do I need a special ball for Beach Volleyball?","text":"<p>Yes, outdoor and beach volleyballs are made for the tough conditions that can be associated with the outdoors.

While these recreational volleyballs look very similar to their premier counterparts, there are some differences, including:<br\/><\/li><li>Non-water resistance composite covers. These covers are still tougher than an indoor volleyball's cover, but most are not designed to be water resistant unless specifically listed.<br\/><\/li><li>Machine stitched panels. These volleyballs are produced at a faster pace in a way that helps lower the costs; however, machine stitches are not as tight as hand stitches. Machine stitched panels are also common in indoor volleyballs. In turn, the volleyballs are less durable and more susceptible to wear and tear than those that are hand stitched.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"d20b9281-3547-4a67-b85f-accf08081d5e":{"type":"question","settings":{"icon":"none","heading":"Do we have discounts for quantity purchasing?","text":"<p>YES!

It is a specific way your artwork is saved. Most people are more familiar with files such as a jpg, gif, png, doc. The reason a vector file is so important is that it gives us the ability to make the artwork bigger or smaller without damaging the image quality. It will also give us the ability to correct any colors, lines, etc that may be necessary when developing the printing process. Without a vector, while not impossible, making the necessary adjustments is more difficult. If you do not have access to this type of file, don't worry!
